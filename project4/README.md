The original data is collected from Twitter, and it is related to 2015 super bowl final - hawks and patriots.
The original data contains about 3,140,000 tweets, and the file size is about 10G. So here we just upload the handled data.
The time is limited, so we did not write the codes perfect, and we know there are lots of improvements needed, however, the codes works well when we submit it so we did not revise it after submission.
